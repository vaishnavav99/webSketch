              <p class="uk-text-justify">We've all heard these terms thrown around everywhere, sometimes, even mixing up the two. Generally there's an air of confusion around these two terms. Whether they are related or if one is a subset of the other or if they are two distinct, different concepts. The short answer is- there is no short answer. A simple yes or no cannot suffice here because context matters. But we're going to take a look into it anyway. </p>
              <p class="uk-text-justify toggle-text">Firstly let's understand a few things. These terms are related, they are not exactly a subset of one another or more accurately they can overlap, and no they cannot be used as one wishes. These things are generally agreed upon. So what's the difference?
                <br><br>Let's start with UI. It's something that's more visible or can be understood easily because it's what we as users come in contact with. UI deals with the look and feel. The animations, the branding, the interactivity etc. There is an artistic creativity that goes into UI. And it is what the users see and hear. So far so good.
                So what's UX then? Well, UX deals more with what the user's can't see. That's an oversimplification. Actually UX deals with the social component of the product. How the customer or an ideal buyer is/will interact with the product. UX deals in how the product solves the problem the user or the client has. This also lends it a marketing component. But it is not solely that. 
                <br><br>The point is however your opinions may vary on the definitions of UI/UX, the fundamental idea is that both are integral in the success of your product. Finally, the exact differences can become clearer once you start in your journey as a UI or UX designer.

    <p class="uk-text-justify">Firebase- a name that can be heard in various web app development / cross platform mobile app development circles. But what exactly is Firebase? Let's start at the beginning.</p>
    <p class="uk-text-justify toggle-text">Firebase was originally launched as a real-time database in 2011. It was acquired by Google in 2014 and has since grown to include many services including things like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging, and, well, it goes on. It basically acts as a Baas( Backend-as-a-Service) model for web apps and mobile app development, taking care of a spectrum of back-end technologies that otherwise would find the developers having to build themselves. It also eliminates the need to maintain hardware, obviously. 
      To delve into each service and their uses will be time consuming but here are a few- Google analytics, Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication, ML Kit, remote config etc.<br><br>
       Firebase provides concise documentation explaining each service in depth, so be sure to check that out. Another benefit is that it requires minimal programming language knowledge making it accessible for almost anyone. 
      Firebase does have its own drawbacks though. One such con is the limited querying capabilities of its Realtime Database owing to the DB being stored as a huge JSON file. All this hasn't even scratched the surface of the capabilities of Firebase and no one explains Firebase better than Firebase. It has its pros and cons like any other piece of software but it certainly is an easily accessible development platform for emerging developers.

<div style="text-align: justify;">                
<p class="uk-text-justify">Xamarin is a software for cross platform app development for Android, iOS and Windows with .NET . Well that piece of information is common. So what is Xamarin exactly? Is it any good? Is it the best? What should you see prepare for if you're trying to poke around with Xamarin? Well the first two questions are a topic of debate. There are developers who like Xamarin and then there are those who don't, preferring alternatives. This is, well, not surprising. Everyone has their own opinions on which is better. So to solve that debate here or trying to, would be futile. Instead let's focus on what Xamarin is. And maybe that'll bring clarity to anyone who is thinking about exploring Xamarin. Becoming open-source after the acquisition by Microsoft, it was also made a part of Visual Studio IDE. Now, about the language. Xamarin uses C# to create apps for all its supported platforms.  </p>
<p class="uk-text-justify toggle-text">Another important thing is it allows engineers to share 90 percent of code across platforms. This essentially enables developers to use a single language to write their business logic while still attaining the native look and feel of the app. There are  two major products, namely Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS. <br><br>Xamarin.Forms is another separate product designed to create prototypes. 
  Additionally Xamarin provides full hardware support eliminating hardware compatibility issues as well as simplified maintenance due to its cross platform nature. One downside is even though Xamarin is open source the commercial use of it requires a Visual Studio license which can be expensive to some. Added to that, it requires additional optimization because the apps end up with a larger size than native apps. <br><br>
  On a final note, Xamarin has its own share of pros and cons just like all the other pieces of software that exist out there. Using Xamarin depends upon what your preferences are as a developer and the products that you want to deliver. The rest is mostly personal choice.

              <h2>Our Psychology & Social Media during Lockdown
               
                </h2>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">

              Posted by <strong> Ashmar V </strong> | April 19 2020</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">                
<p class="uk-text-justify">Its been over a year since we have all been in quarantine .The 'Stay at Home' directive is absolutely necessary in order to eradicate this global pandemic that's tragically consuming innocent lives exponentially. 
  The positive outcomes of this lockdown 
  are numerous yet there are a lot of downsides to it. The economic degradation,  job recession, national development , risk of livelihood are some of the most talked about issues regarding the lockdown effects. But i would like to raise concerns about one of the least addressed issues, the Psychological effect of lockdown on us .
  Specifically i would like to address how Social Media has impacted our daily life in this time of crisis.
  </p>
<p class="uk-text-justify toggle-text">
  The bare interaction with people and sudden barrage on proceeding with our normal life has definitely taken a mental toll on us. It has convoluted our behavior and our response to social stimuli for better or for worse. 
  The Quarantine has led us to a phase of self introspection and a calmer environment where we are able to percieve the things around us much more clearly and has let us develop a  deep and abstract vision on the continuous loopy cycle of the worldly life.  It has given most of us a chance to spend more time with our family,  discover new hobbies and traits and develop a resonating appreciation for the life and freedom we had prior to the lockdown. 
  At the same time this prolonged self containment has physically and emotionally made us less active , prone to several mental disorders and has paved way to an unsettling addiction towards technology especially social media which will surely negatively impact us post lockdown. <br><br>
  People who tend to be social distancing on their own are likely to have anxiety disorders,  panic attacks,  depression and display manic behaviour as a result of the introverted environment they are forced to reside in. 
  People who are bipolar,  manic or who suffer from borderline personality disorder  or OCD are likely to be affected the most and require desperate help to retrieve a stable and sound mind. <br><br>
  
  Technology (Social Media)  can be a way out of this misery and can help you stay in touch with your loved ones-friends and family and also stay connected to the world keeping us informed on literally everything happening around the world. 
  It has partially been effective on spreading vital information required to keep us safe. 
  Yet the technology surrounding us has obviously pulled us into a loop of addiction where we are constantly dependent on our smartphones,  tablets or TVs for infotainment etc. The need to check our phones every passing minute for new messages and story updates displays our desperate and humiliating fixation on Social Media. Technology in a way also drives to laziness where any form of physical task seems gruesome. This will severely impact our Post Lockdown Behavior as we will tend to be more introverted in character,  find discomfort in huge crowds and also strips our analytical capabalities of various social circumstances waiting ahead of us. We would develop a notion of e-communication and may even tend to avoid any physical communication at all when we are required to interact in different social circles. Sudden exposure to the outside world after the lockdown would be emotionally draining especially since we will all be trying to get back on our feet with regards to our education and jobs .
  While extroverts are  having a hard time staying indoors, introverts are more likely to face the problems mentioned above post lockdown. <br><br>
  
  Nevertheless everyone is required to practice ways to maintain their mental and physical health in order to boost our energy and confidence during these difficult times.
  Some of them include maintaining a proper sleep cycle, meditating,  practicing deep breathing, trying aromatherapy, staying away from alcohol, smoking and also minimizing the use of technology. 
  Let us definitely hope and pray for the best and prepare ourselves for the obstacles and endeavors waiting for us in the wake of this Global Pandemic.

<div style="text-align: justify;">                
<p class="uk-text-justify">Anyone dipping their toes into the world of web development must have heard of the word. But what is it exactly? Well Django is an open source high level Python Web framework. Wait a minute, so what's a framework? In the simplest sense of the word, it is a platform for developing software applications. They provide a basic wireframe so that developers don't have to start from scratch. 
  Going by the organisations and institutions that use Django we can say it is worth investing time into. And some of those organisations include NASA, Spotify, Washington Post etc. 
   </p>
<p class="uk-text-justify toggle-text">Using Django depends on what you want to make. Do you want an app that must be secure from basic attacks and vulnerabilities by default? An app that you can downscale or upscale any time? Or maybe you want to deploy fast and have the flexibility to change it as you move ahead? Well, for all this and more Django is the framework for you. Added to this you have a good community backing which means a thorough documentation to help you if you get stuck. But why take my word for it? Try it out for yourselves.
